# USA Mathematical Olympiad 2017, Problem 5

Determine the set of positive real numbers c such that there exists
a labeling of the lattice points in ℤ² with positive integers for which:

  1. only finitely many distinct labels occur, and
  2. for each label i, the distance between any two points labeled i
     is at most cⁱ.
