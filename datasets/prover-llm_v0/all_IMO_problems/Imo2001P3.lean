# International Mathematical Olympiad 2001, Problem 3

Twenty-one girls and twenty-one boys took part in a mathematical competition.
It turned out that each contestant solved at most six problems, and for each
pair of a girl and a boy, there was at most one problem solved by both the
girl and the boy. Show that there was a problem solved by at least three
girls and at least three boys.
