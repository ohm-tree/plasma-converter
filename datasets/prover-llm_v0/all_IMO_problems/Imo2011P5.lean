# International Mathematical Olympiad 2011, Problem 5

Let f be a function from the set of integers to the set
of positive integers. Suppose that, for any two integers
m and n, the difference f(m) - f(n) is divisible by
f (m - n). Prove that, for all integers m and n with
f(m) ≤ f(n), the number f(n) is divisible by f(m).
