Divide 180 by 2: \\(180 \u00f7 2 = 90\\). So, 2 is a prime factor.\n2. Divide 90 by 2: \\(90 \u00f7 2 = 45\\). So, another 2 is a prime factor.\n3. Divide 45 by 3: \\(45 \u00f7 3 = 15\\). So, 3 is a prime factor.\n4. Divide 15 by 3: \\(15 \u00f7 3 = 5\\). So, another 3 is a prime factor.\n5. 5 is a prime number, so it's a prime factor.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 180 is:\n\\[180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\]\n\n*Prime factorization of 168:*\n1. Divide 168 by 2: \\(168 \u00f7 2 = 84\\). So, 2 is a prime factor.\n2. Divide 84 by 2: \\(84 \u00f7 2 = 42\\). So, another 2 is a prime factor.\n3. Divide 42 by 2: \\(42 \u00f7 2 = 21\\). So, another 2 is a prime factor.\n4. Divide 21 by 3: \\(21 \u00f7 3 = 7\\). So, 3 is a prime factor.\n5. 7 is a prime number, so it's a prime factor.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 168 is:\n\\[168 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 7\\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify the common prime factors with the smallest exponents.**\n\nThe common prime factors are 2 and 3.\n- For 2: The smallest exponent between \\(2^2\\) (from 180) and \\(2^3\\) (from 168) is 2.\n- For 3: The smallest exponent between \\(3^2\\) (from 180) and \\(3\\) (which is \\(3^1\\) from 168) is 1.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the common prime factors with their smallest exponents to find the GCF.**\n\\[\n\\text{GCF} = 2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe greatest common factor of 180 and 168 is indeed 12.\n\n**Answer:** 12", "time_taken": 10.569268226623535}
