We know that at her fifth practice, she made 48 free throws. Let's denote the number of free throws she made at each practice as \\( F_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the practice number.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F_5 = 48 \\)\n- Each practice, she makes twice as many free throws as the previous one: \\( F_n = 2 \\times F_{n-1} \\)\n\nStarting from the fifth practice and working backward:\n\n1. Find \\( F_4 \\):\n   \\[\n   F_5 = 2 \\times F_4 \\implies F_4 = \\frac{F_5}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24\n   \\]\n   \n2.
