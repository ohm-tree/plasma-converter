Therefore, the key is to calculate how many extra steps Tim will take after completing as many full circles as possible within 139 steps.\n\nFirst, divide 139 by 11 to find out how many full circles Tim completes and how many steps remain:\n\n\\(139 \\div 11 = 12\\) full circles with a remainder of \\(7\\) steps.\n\nSo, after completing 12 full circles (which is \\(12 \\times 11 = 132\\) steps), Tim has \\(7\\) steps remaining.\n\nStarting from step 1, when Tim takes \\(7\\) more steps, he ends up on:\n\n\\( \\text{Final Step} = (\\text{Starting Step} + \\text{Remaining Steps}) \\mod 11 \\)\n\\( \\text{Final Step} = (1 + 7) \\mod 11 \\)\n\\( \\text{Final Step} = 8 \\)\n\nTherefore, Tim will end up on step 8 after taking a total of 139 steps.\n\n**Answer:** 8", "time_taken": 46.62230205535889}
