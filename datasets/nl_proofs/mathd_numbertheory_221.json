A number \\( n \\) will have exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number. This is because:\n\n- If \\( n = p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime, then its divisors are \\( 1 \\), \\( p \\), and \\( p^2 \\).\n- No other numbers less than 1000 have exactly three divisors since any composite number squared would have more than three divisors.\n\nTherefore, our task reduces to finding all prime numbers \\( p \\) such that \\( p^2 < 1000 \\).\n\nLet's list the squares of prime numbers until we reach a square that is equal to or exceeds 1000:\n\n1. \\( 2^2 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( 3^2 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n4. \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n5. \\( 11^2 = 121 \\)\n6. \\( 13^2 = 169 \\)\n7. \\( 17^2 = 289 \\)\n8. \\( 19^2 = 361 \\)\n9. \\( 23^2 = 529 \\)\n10. \\( 29^2 = 841 \\)\n11. \\( 31^2 = 961 \\)\n12. \\( 37^2 = 1369 \\) (This is greater than 1000, so we stop here.)\n\nThere are 11 primes \\( p \\) (from \\( p = 2 \\) to \\( p = 31 \\)) such that \\( p^2 < 1000 \\). Therefore, there are 11 natural numbers less than 1000 that are squares of primes, and hence have exactly three distinct positive divisors.\n\n**Answer:** 11", "time_taken": 10.427290201187134}
