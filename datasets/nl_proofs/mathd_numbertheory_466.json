The digital root of a number is the iterative sum of its digits until we get a single digit:\n\n1. Sum the digits of 55:\n\n\\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \\]\n\n2. Since 10 is more than a single digit, sum its digits:\n\n\\[ 1 + 0 = 1 \\]\n\nThis digital root tells us that \\( 55 \\mod 9 = 1 \\).\n\n**Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 9 is 1.**\n\n**Answer:** 1", "time_taken": 7.0528724193573}
