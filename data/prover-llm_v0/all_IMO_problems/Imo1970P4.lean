# International Mathematical Olympiad 1970, Problem 4

Determine the set of all positive integers n with the property that
the set {n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, n + 5} can be partitioned
into two sets such that the product of the numbers in one set
equals the product of the nubmers in the other set.
