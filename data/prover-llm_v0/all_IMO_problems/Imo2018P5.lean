# International Mathematical Olympiad 2018, Problem 5

Let a₁, a₂, ... be an infinite sequence of positive integers.
Suppose that there is an integer N > 1 such that for each n ≥ N
the number

   a₁/a₂ + a₂/a₃ ... + aₙ₋₁/aₙ + aₙ/a₁

is an integer. Prove that there is a positive integer M such that
aₘ = aₘ₊₁ for all m ≥ M.
