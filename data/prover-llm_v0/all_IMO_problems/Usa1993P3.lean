# USA Mathematical Olympiad 1993, Problem 3

Consider functions f : [0,1] → ℝ which satisfy

  (i)   f(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [0,1]
  (ii)  f(1) = 1
  (iii) f(x) + f(y) ≤ f (x + y) whenever x, y and x + y are all in [0,1].

Determine the smallest constant c such that

       f(x) ≤ cx

for every function satisfying (i) - (iii) and every x ∈ [0,1].
